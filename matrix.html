<p>How to connect to our Matrix server</p>
<pre>
1. Go to a Matrix client like <a href="https://element.io/download">Element</a> and sign up using the homeserver 'matrix.pwnsec.net' (NOT matrix.org)
2. Message @wuemeli on Discord for a token and enter it when prompted
3. Go to the space called '/home/pwnsec' and explore our rooms

Please note the Matrix server may be offline from time to time due to it being hosted by a 3rd party
